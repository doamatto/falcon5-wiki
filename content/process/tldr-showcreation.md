1. Grab the flash drive in the Tricaster and copy the segments from the iMac closest to the door onto the drive. Insert an <abbr title="glorified SD card">SXS card</abbr> into the TriCaster's Sony reader.
    - The computer's password is `bigfoot`
    - You can delete anything but the `Falcon Five Intro` file or similar
2. Adjust the lights so that:
    - Channel 1 & 2: 8
    - Channel 3: 3.5
3. Turn on the cameras using the switch on the left side of the camera near the lens. Put the lens cap on the <abbr title="tripod with wheels">pedastal</abbr>
    - The camera should be pointed to have the anchors level
    - Leave about half a centimetre of room from the bottom to leave room for any lower-thirds
4. Import the footage on the Tricaster by:
    - Turning on the Tricsater, selecting a New session, and ensuring the quality is set to "1080i"
    - Ensuring that camera 1, 2, and 4 all have input; *there is no camera 3.*
    - Selecting the `+` in the bottom left of the TriCaster window under the "DDR1" tab, selecting `Browse`, and selecting all the footage on the thumbdrive (it should be labelled as "Removable Drive")
5. Give the anchors ~5mn to run their lines. Check in and set a firm time for when the show will be starting.
6. Ensure that the recording will go onto the inserted SXS card by selecting the setting cog in the top right where `Record` is, then press `REC` on the board or click the `Record` button in the top right.
8. Stop recording, shutdown the TriCaster, and eject the SXS card. Connect it to the left Mac Pro in the classroom
    - The password must be requested
9. Encode the video using Handbrake
    - Copy the file off the SXS card to the Desktop
    - Open Handbrake and import the file by drag-and-drop or using the Open dialog
    - Ensure the preset is set to "Tricaster to Web" and nothing else (including "Tricaster to Web (Legacy)")
10. Upload the finished video to [YouTube.](https://youtube.com/upload)
